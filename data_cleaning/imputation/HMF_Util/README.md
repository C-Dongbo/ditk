# Bayesian Hybrid Matrix Factorisation for Data Integration
This project contains an implementation of the Bayesian hybrid matrix factorisation model presented in the paper 

[**Bayesian hybrid matrix factorisation for data integration**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04962), Thomas Brouwer, Pietro Lio', published at the 20th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2017).

#### Original Code

https://github.com/ThomasBrouwer/HMF

#### Input and Output

Input:
This model takes as input a dataset which may or may not have missing values
If no missing values, it introduces missingness into the data

Output:
The model outputs a predicted dataset with predicted values for the missing data

#### Description

Task: Apply Non Negative Matrix Factorization for Data Imputation

Approach:
1. Decompose a given matrix (dataset) into two smaller matrices (latent factors), so that their product approximates the original matrix
2. This method extracts hidden structure in the data, and allows the prediction of missing values

#### Evaluation

The benchmark datasets used for this project were:

1. UCI Breast Cancer Dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer
2. UCI Spam Dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase
3. UCI Letters Dataset - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition

The evaluation metric used was Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

Results:

1. UCI Breast Cancer Dataset - RMSE: 0.4950865997
2. UCI Spam Dataset - RMSE: 0.128437365988
3. UCI Letters Dataset - RMSE: 1.13686353267
