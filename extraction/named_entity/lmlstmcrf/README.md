### Input/Output for Prediction
Input
Space separated format generalized for the group.
Index 0 - Text
Index 3 - Named Entity Label
```
EU NNP I-NP I-ORG - - - - - - - -
rejects VBZ I-VP O - - - - - - - -
German JJ I-NP I-MISC - - - - - - - -
call NN I-NP O - - - - - - - -
to TO I-VP O - - - - - - - -
```

Output
```
text true_label prediction 
```

### Input/Output for Training
Same as above

### Task Overview
The project's task is to perform named entity recognition given a sequence of words for a sentence. This model uses a novel
approach of multitasking language model sequence labeling and named entity recognition simultaneously which shared weights.
It also uses highway connections to link character level weights from the language model to the word level bi-lstm to take 
both features into account.

### Evaluation metrics and results
|         |ConLL 2003|Ontonotes|Chemdner|
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
|F1       |0.908     |0.783    |0.782   |
|Recall   |0.906     |0.752    |0.761   |
|Precision|0.907     |0.816    |0.805   |

Ontonotes and Chemdner were both trained on a subset of equal size to ConLL 2003
