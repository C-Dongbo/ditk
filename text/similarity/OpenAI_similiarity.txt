To run base code clone the original github code. The current code only runs the question and answering part of the paper
on the ROC stories test. I looked into trying to code the header myself but could not accomplish it.

To run the code on the ROC stories test:
python train.py --dataset rocstories --desc rocstories --submit --analysis --data_dir [path to data here]

This is command prompt.
