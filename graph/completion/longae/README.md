### Input/Output for Prediction
Input
* N x N adjacency matrix with 10% links set to \<unk\> (N is the number of nodes)
* N x F matrix of node features (F is the number of features per node)

Output
* N x N adjacency matrix with all links (N is the number of nodes)
* N x C matrix of one-hot label classes (C is the number of classes)

### Input/Output for Training
Input
* N x N adjacency matrix with 10% links set to <unk> (N is the number of nodes)
* N x F matrix of node features (F is the number of features per node)
* N x C matrix of one-hot label classes (C is the number of classes)

### Task Overview
The project is to perform multitask link prediction and node classification simultaneously using a keras autoencoder model.
Given a dataset consisting of an adjacency matrixs where one indicates reference and zero indicates lack of reference to another node,
we set a subset of links as unknown to perform training and prediction. We augment the matrix with an additional word embedding feature
for each node given a specific classification of the node as a one hot vector as well to do node classification. We combine these tasks 
together using the autoencoder model.
